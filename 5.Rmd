There are several approaches to conduct power analyses for LMMs in `R`:  
- **simr**: Simulation-based function to estimate power of LMMs.  
- **mlpwr**: ML algorithm to find the optimal sample size and number of time points.  
- **PowerAnalysisLM**: A Shiny app for (longitudinal) LLMs that account for temporal dependencies in multi-level data.

# Example using `simr`:

```{r, message=F}
# load package
library(simr)

# seed
set.seed(123)
```

**Planned study**:  
Intervention for patients with depression. Participants are randomized to treatment vs control groups and complete weekly PHQ-9 assessments. A linear mixed-effects model with random intercepts and slopes evaluates the week × group interaction.

**Model outline**:  
`PHQ9 ~ week * group + (week | id)`

```{r, message=F}
# create design data
id <- factor(1:40)
time <- 1:6
group <- c("control", "intervention")

data <- data.frame(id = rep(id, each = length(time)),
                   time = rep(time, length(id)),
                   group = rep(rep(group, each = length(time)), 
                               length(id)/2))

head(data, n = 20)
```

**Plausible parameter values**:  
Fixed effects: 
`b0` (baseline mean, control): 14   
`b1` (weekly change, control): −0.2/week   
`b2` (baseline arm difference): 0   
`b3` (additional weekly change with treatment): −0.5/week   
  
Random effects (between-person variability)   
SD(b0) (random intercept): 3 (Var = 9)  
SD(b1) (random slope per week): 0.25 (Var = 0.0625)  
Corr(b0, b1): −0.3 (people starting higher tend to improve faster)   
  
Residual SD: 2.5 (Var = 6.25)

```{r}
# intercept and slopes for group, time, and group:time
fixed <- c(14, 0, -0.2, -0.5)

# random intercepts and slope (variance)
rand <- list(9, -0.3, 0.0625)

# residual (standard deviation)
res <- 2.5
```

```{r}
# fit model
model <- makeLmer(y ~ group * time + (time|id),
                  fixef=fixed, VarCorr=rand, sigma=res, data=data)
summary(model)
```

```{r, results='hide', message=F}
# power analysis
sim <- powerSim(model, nsim = 250, test = fixed("group:time"))
```

```{r}

                      test = fixed("group:time"), 
                      along = "id", 
                      breaks = c(20, 40, 60, 80, 100))
```

                               length(id)/2))
