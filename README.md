What is EMA / Intensive Longitudinal Data?
Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA), also known as intensive longitudinal data, refers to data collected repeatedly over time in ecologically valid settings (e.g. multiple times per day, across days or weeks).
Such data allow us to study within-person dynamics, temporal processes, feedback loops, and time-varying associations.
Key characteristics:
High-frequency sampling (multiple observations per subject over time)
Nested/time-series and multilevel structure
Within-person variation and dynamics are central
Requires modeling techniques that account for autocorrelation, intraindividual variability, and between-person heterogeneity
