## Multilevel Models for Emotion Time Series

### 1. Motivation & Data Structure

When emotion ratings are collected repeatedly over time for each participant, observations are nested within individuals. A standard regression ignores this dependency and underestimates standard errors. A multilevel model (also called mixed-effects model) handles:

- Level 1 (Within-person): How emotion varies over time *for each* person  
- Level 2 (Between-person): How these trajectories differ *across* people  

Our example dataset has 3 participants (`subject = 1,2,3`), each rated on 30 occasions (`time = 1,2,...,30`). The column `emotion` is the outcome.

```{r}
# simulate data
library(lme4)

# estimate model
fit <- lmer(emotion ~ time + (1|id), data = data)

# View results
summary(fit)
```

```{r}
# load package
library(lme4)

# estimate random intercept model
fit <- lmer(emotion ~ time + (1|id), data = data)

# View results
summary(fit)
```
