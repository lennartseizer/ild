title: "Power analysis"

```{r, echo=FALSE}
install.packages("simr")
```

There are several approaches to conduct power analyses for LMMs in `R`:
* *simr*: Simulation-based function to estimate power of LMMs.
* *mlpwr*: ML algorithm to find the optimal sample size and number of time points.
* *PowerAnalysisLM*: A Shiny app for (longitudinal) LLMs that account for temporal dependencies in multi-level data.

# Example using `simr`:
```{r}
library(simr)
```
