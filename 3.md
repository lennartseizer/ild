## Multilevel Models for Emotion Time Series

### 1. Motivation & Data Structure

When emotion ratings are collected repeatedly over time for each participant, observations are **nested** within individuals. A standard regression ignores this dependency and underestimates standard errors. A **multilevel model** (also called mixed-effects model) handles:

- **Level 1 (Within-person):** How emotion varies over time *for each* person  
- **Level 2 (Between-person):** How these trajectories differ *across* people  

Our example dataset has 3 participants (`subject = 1,2,3`), each rated on 30 occasions (`time = 1â€¦30`). The column `emotion` is the outcome.

// Example can be run directly in your JavaScript console

// Create a function that takes two arguments and returns the sum of those arguments
var adder = new Function("a", "b", "return a + b");

// Call the function
adder(2, 6);
